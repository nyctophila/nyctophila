Hi, I’m @nyctophila
I’m a student, and am currently in high school. 
I love art and music, and just creating things in general, whether virtual, or actual.
I learnt some python, some html, some c by myself, so I know how coding works, but I dont remember most of the specifics.
I am not particularly looking for something to collaborate on, but I'd be happy to try.
